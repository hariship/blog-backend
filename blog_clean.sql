86	Everything everywhere all at once	everything-everywhere-all-at-once	I built a personal Telegram bot that updates my Slack status, logs moments. A quiet system that works behind the scenes, just for me.	https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/everything_everywhere_all_at_once.jpeg	\N	2025-08-08 13:23:06.983	<hr><p>Lately, I've been setting up a little system at home that helps me stay connected and a little more organised. I am calling the system <strong><em>home-bot</em></strong>. It started small, but it's growing into something quite fun.</p><p>At first, I synced all my contacts from Google into a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">database</a>. Then, I used a WhatsApp BOT to pull in details like emails and other info about the people I talk to. But WhatsApp came with its own limits, costs and heaviness, so I switched to <a href="https://web.telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>. It's free, flexible, and just works.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><br></p><p><img src="https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/8c6f2c40-4433-4341-a123-0a2c92745e5d.png" style="display: block; margin: 16px auto; max-width: 100%;"></p><p>One of the first things I built is I can now chat to my Telegram bot to update my <strong>slack</strong> status.</p><p>&nbsp;Just typing something like:</p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">coffee @quilt\n</pre><p>Will update my Slack status in the `@quilt` workspace to "<strong>Coffee</strong>".</p><p><em>Since I'm part of multiple developer communities on Slack (and don't want to bug everyone with personal updates), I can choose which workspace to update using that @ mention.</em></p><p>And when I'm done?</p><pre class="ql-syntax" spellcheck="false">clear @quilt\n</pre><p>Removes it. Like magic and I am loving it âœ¨</p><p>I call this project <strong><em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em></strong><em>,</em> because that's exactly what it feels like. One place, one system, handling all the little threads of communication and connection in my life.</p><p>The system also build documentation itself, automatically using <a href="https://www.knowledgekeeper.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KK</a> as I push changes to github. (will write more once its complete).</p><p>I'm slowly turning home-bot into something that just fits around me.</p><ul><li>Talking to it using voice (via <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whisper</a> API)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/immich-app/immich" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Syncing</a> core memory photos I'm fond of</li><li>Little nudges and logs that make sense only to me</li></ul><p>Not trying to build a Business. Just something small, helpful, and personal.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything, everywhere, at once - just for me(for now).</p>	Work	https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/everything_everywhere_all_at_once.jpeg

I felt buried in work and caught in my own thoughts. I kept going until I finally broke down.</p><p>My friends and especially Hemanth was with me through it. Although I keep things personal, some days I leaned on him for support. Some days I pulled away. I know it was not easy, but he stayed and that mattered.</p><hr><p>One evening I was riding back home on my bike. My head was full, and I felt the stress climbing. I stopped at a small coffee shop and sat there scrolling through my gallery. We recently bought a few fishes, worried about their change of water, I had their movements recorded. So I watched their clips. They move, they eat, they chase each other, and then they rest. No overthinking, no guilt, no weight of tomorrow. Watching them somehow brought the thought back to me: <em>I am just a virus in the body of the universe.</em></p><p><img src="https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/d1e19398-9918-449a-98a6-cbd74746ccea.png" style="display: block; margin: 16px auto; max-width: 100%;"></p><hr><p>As the old saying goes, a virus does not stop to think. It just moves. It keeps going. I realised I had been living the same way, always tuned to keep doing, always moving.</p><ul><li>Sometimes the virus wants to break out of the circle and leave it all behind. </li><li>Sometimes it feels safe staying inside, moving in the rhythm it knows. </li><li>Sometimes it adds more, spreading, creating, touching the other viruses around it to create impact. </li><li>Sometimes the load is too heavy for one small virus to carry or make an impact. It just lives.</li></ul><p>That thought humbled me. Maybe that is enough for me too. To get stuck someday, not get stuck someday, grow into a bigger virus, eat all I want, infect the universe around me, and then try to save it. Or wait for good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bacteriophage</a> to get poured in the universe to save itself upon luck. It does not always have to make sense. That is just how we are. </p><p>I remember once telling a friend that probability is something I never fully understood. But this analogy, in its own strange way, made more sense to me. We create, we share, we touch the lives around us or maybe we don't. I am just here for now, part of the circle, part of the building. We are some species thats trying to make, trying to know itself. And maybe that is enough.</p>	Motives	https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/fishes.jpeg
88	Notes (31-34) - 2025	notes-31-34-2025	The past few weeks have been a mix of low moods, small repairs, thoughts, and moments that made me stop and notice.

Things have not been great still writing them down feels like a way to gather those pieces into one place and move past it.</p><hr><ul><li>Vidhya and I attended a stage play called 'Kindan charithiram'. For the show, they had a bell to signal when it is about to start, no phones or camera, and a chai shop just beneath the place. Simple but refreshing, reminded me a lot of my old times with my brother and peripa.</li></ul><p><img src="https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/c300410a-2de4-4b7a-9918-7f64bd318e47.png" style="display: block; margin: 16px auto; max-width: 100%;"></p><ul><li>After ages, I finally got my wall clock repaired. It felt oddly satisfying to have something fixed instead of replaced. I also got curious about how mechanical clocks work and realised why watches from brands like Citizen and Seiko are priced the way they are.</li></ul><p><img src="https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/3751c6ae-b911-4718-a125-97f2546d13df.png" style="display: block; margin: 16px auto; max-width: 100%;"></p><ul><li>We bought fish recently. Watching them made me reflect on a few things that I ended up writing a <a href="https://blog.haripriya.org/post/here-for-now" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> about it.</li><li>One evening I took Tars out to Indira Nagar. I've always travelled alone without having to think about much, but that day felt different. The streets seemed sharper, the crowd in the streets were different, and all I could think of getting him home safe. In that moment I longed for familiarity. I've never been one to seek one while travelling, but I understood how it can offer peace when the world feels too sharp.</li><li>Through most of the weeks I was feeling low,  so I ended up either spending a lot of time with movies or occupied with work. I finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Snow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Society of the Snow</em></a> and watched a couple of good Tamil films like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3BHK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>3BHK</em></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36931506/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Paranthu Po</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32827713/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Thalaivan Thalaivi</em></a>. We also watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie_(2025_film)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Coolie</em></a>, which I kind of liked.</li><li>All of this made me want a fresh start of my own, so I gave my blog a small revamp with a dark theme toggle at the top right corner of the posts and homepage, and even gave my hair a little retouch with curls. Small changes, but together they felt like pressing reset.</li></ul>	Life	https://hp-blog-contents.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/images/tickets.jpeg
